title: "Provenance and depositional setting of Lower Silurian siliciclastic rocks on Hainan Island, South China: Implications for a passive margin environment of South China in Gondwana"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/4/11/2016-Zou, et al., 2016
excerpt: 'The detrital zircon U-Pb age populations with peaks mainly at ca. 1635 Ma indicate that the source rocks are dominated by the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group and ca. 1430 Ma granitoids on Hainan Island. Linked to the early Paleozoic tectonic development of South China, the Lower Silurian siliciclastic rocks on Hainan Island can be interpreted as depositing in a passive continent margin.'
