Provenance and depositional setting of Lower Silurian siliciclastic rocks on Hainan Island, South China: Implications for a passive margin environment of South China in Gondwana. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences 123, 243-262."	"Diverse models have been proposed for interpreting the early Paleozoic tectonic setting of the Cathaysia Block in South China. However, few of them undertook a comprehensive study of clastic sedimentary rocks in the Cathaysia Block. This study reports the petrography and sedimentary facies, the whole-rock geochemistry and Sm-Nd isotopic data, and the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of detrital zircon from the Lower Silurian meta-siliciclastics on Hainan Island in order to constrain the early Paleozoic tectonic setting. The source rocks for the Lower Silurian meta-siliciclastics have suffered moderate to intense weathering, indicated by the weathering indices, like Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) and Weathering Index (W index). The Lower Silurian rocks have high Th/Sc (generally between 1.1 and 2.0) and Th/U (generally between 4 and 6) ratios, LREE-enriched REE patterns with negative Eu anomalies (avg. 0.55), and low ?Nd(t) values (-16.2 to -8.5), suggesting a continental margin basin receiving detritus mostly derived from a recycled-orogen or cratonic provenance. This Early Silurian turbiditic succession with rhythmic flysch and incomplete Bouma sequences also reveals a neritic to abyssal facies, continental shelf to continental slope depositional setting. The geochemical features like the pattern of REEs, the ratios of trace elements (e.g., Th/Sc, Th/Co, La/Sc, Cr/Th, La/Th), and the binary plots and ternary diagrams (e.g., A-CN-K and FMW diagram), demonstrate that the source-areas are dominated by felsic rocks. Together with the two-stage Nd depleted mantle model age (TDM-2) (ca. 2.3 Ga), the detrital zircon U-Pb age populations with peaks mainly at ca. 1635 Ma confirm that the source rocks are dominated by the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group and ca. 1430 Ma granitoids on Hainan Island. Linked to the early Paleozoic tectonic development of South China, the Lower Silurian siliciclastic rocks on Hainan Island can be interpreted as depositing in a passive continent margin."	https://doi:10.1016/j.jseaes.2016.04.011					"Zou, et al., 2016"

Precambrian Research	---	"Zou, S., Yu, L., Yu, D., Xu, D., Ye, T., Wang, Z., Cai, J., Liu, M."	"Zou, S., Yu, L., Yu, D., Xu, D., Ye, T., Wang, Z., Cai, J., Liu, M., 2017. Precambrian continental crust evolution of Hainan Island in South China: Constraints from detrital zircon Hf isotopes of metaclastic-sedimentary rocks in the Shilu Fe-Co-Cu ore district. Precambrian Research 296, 195-207. "	"Combined with the previous detrital zircons U-Pb ages of the two Precambrian successions, i.e. the Shilu Group and the Shihuiding Formation in Hainan Island of South China, the in situ Lu-Hf isotopes of detrital zircons were performed to evaluate the growth and reworking of Hainan Island continental crust during Precambrian. The results of 171 Hf-isotopic analyses on zircon grains from the Shihuiding Formation yield176Hf/177Hf ratios between 0.280786 and 0.281188,176Lu/177Hf ratios between 0.000228 and 0.003388, Hf model ages (TDMC) between 3.8 Ga and 1.2 Ga, and ?Hf(t) values ranging from ?12.5 to +10.6. The analyzed results of 272 Hf-isotopic data on zircon grains from the Shilu Group exhibit a wide range of176Hf/177Hf ratios (0.280810â€?.282512),176Lu/177Hf ratios (0.000062â€?.004060), TDMCages (3.7 Gaâ€?.1 Ga), and ?Hf(t) values (?20.5 to +12.3). The continental crust of Hainan Island maybe appeared firstly at ca. 4.0â€?.8 Ga and then was reworked. The 91.8% of detrital zircon grains from the Shihuiding Formation and 93.8% of the ones from the Shilu Group have crustal incubation time larger than 300 Ma, indicating an involvement of reworked materials into the sedimentation of both the successions. Unambiguously, the crustal basement rocks in Hainan Island were formed mainly through reworking the previous continental components with minor input of juvenile materials. The generation of juvenile curst in Hainan Island predominantly occurred at ca. 2.7 Ga and ca. 1.5â€?.0 Ga, which are consistent with that for the assembly of the Kenorland, and the Columbia breakup and subsequent amalgamation of the Rodinia, respectively. The present study further reveals that the crustal growths in Hainan Island are present at 2.7 Ga, 2.3 Ga and 2.1â€?.8 Ga, which is more favorable to the episodic growth mode. Moreover, a rough trend of decreasing maximum crustal incubation time of Hainan Island demonstrates that the incubation time of the juvenile crust is shorter when compared with that of the Cathaysia Block in the late Mesoproterozoic. Link to the previously reported geological works, we consider that Hainan Island did not share the same evolution history with the Cathaysia Block of South China during Precambrian."	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2017.02.011					"Zou, et al., 2017"

Ore Geology Reviews	---	"Zou, S., Zou, F., Ning, J., Deng, T., Yu, D., Ye, T., Xu, D., Wang, Z."	"Zou, S., Zou, F., Ning, J., Deng, T., Yu, D., Ye, T., Xu, D., Wang, Z., 2018. A stand-alone Co mineral deposit in northeastern Hunan Province, South China: Its timing, origin of ore fluids and metal Co, and geodynamic setting. Ore Geology Reviews 92, 42-60. "	"The Hengdong cobalt (Co) deposit, located in northeastern Hunan Province of South China, is hosted by the low-grade metamorphic volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks of the early Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group. The Co orebodies strictly controlled by the NE- to ENE-trending Changsha-Pingjiang deep fault zone (CPDFZ) and its secondary structures. Occurring in altered breccias and cataclasites with similar mineral assemblages, Co mineralization is characterized by zoned alteration with predominant silicification and chloritization proximal to the orebodies, and sericitization and carbonatization distal from the mineralization. The integrated field and microscope observations reveal three hydrothermal stages marked by quartz + pyrite + muscovite Ã‚Â± chalcopyrite of the early-stage mineralization (E-stage), quartz + polymetallic sulfides + chlorite of the middle-stage mineralization (M?stage), and quartz + chlorite + carbonate of the late-stage mineralization (L-stage). Muscovite from both the E-stage Co-bearing altered breccia and the CPDFZ mylonite yield40ArÃ¢â‚¬â€?9Ar plateau ages of 124.7 Ã‚Â± 0.6 Ma (1?) and 130.3 Ã‚Â± 1.4 Ma (1?), respectively, indicating an early Cretaceous mineralization likely associated with the last movement of CPDFZ strike-slip shearing. The ?34S values of pyrite and chalcopyrite ranging from ?1.5 to ?15.9% with a majority between ?7.5 and ?15.9%, and the lead isotope compositions of the pyrite (206Pb/204Pb = 18.156Ã¢â‚¬â€?8.761,207Pb/204Pb = 15.645Ã¢â‚¬â€?5.662 and208Pb/204Pb = 38.469Ã¢â‚¬â€?9.172) overlapping with those of upper crust, indicate a main crust-derived source. The chemical compositions of pyrite further indicate the ore fluids and metal Co of the Hengdong deposit are most likely linked to the meta-mafic and volcanic rocks of the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Lianyunshan Group, but with a contamination by the wall rocks of Lengjiaxi Group and Lianyunshan granitoids. Fluid inclusion investigations from Hengdong deposit reveal the decreasing homogenization temperatures from 250 to 320 Ã‚Â°C (peak of 280Ã¢â‚¬â€?00 Ã‚Â°C) at the E stage, through ?220Ã¢â‚¬â€?20 Ã‚Â°C (peak of 270Ã¢â‚¬â€?00 Ã‚Â°C) at the M stage, and to ?150Ã¢â‚¬â€?30 Ã‚Â°C at the L stage without obviously salinity (7.0Ã¢â‚¬â€?5 wt% NaCl equiv.) changed. In the M?stage, the presence of coexisting LV inclusions and V-rich inclusions with the similar homogenization temperature, consistent with the chlorite geothermometry data, is interpreted to be the result of fluid immiscibility, which was caused by cyclic pressure release during fault-zone movement. Combined with the Late Mesozoic tectonism of South China, the present data support the Hengdong deposit formed under an extension-associated tectonic regime most likely induced by slab roll-back of the subducted Paleo-Pacific Plate during the early Cretaceous. This extensional event not only caused the reactivation of the pre-existing structures as manifested by the CPDFZ characteristic of stress transformation from compression to extension but also likely resulted in the release of large amounts of Co-bearing ore fluids from the Proterozoic or older volcanogenic rocks. When the ore fluids migrated along the CPDFZ and its secondary faults, the decompression (adiabatic cooling) of the hydrothermal fluids shifted the ore fluid to the immiscibility field, significantly reduced the degree of cobalt undersaturation, and caused cobalt to precipitate, which finally formed the Hengdong Co mineral deposit."	https://doi:10.1016/j.oregeorev.2017.11.008					"Zou, et al., 2018"
2019-04-11	Geochemical variations of the Late Mesozoic granitoids in the southern margin of North China Craton: A possible link to the tectonic transformation from compression to extension.	Gondwana Research	---	"Zou, S., Xu, D., Deng, T., Huang, Q., Yu, D., Zhao, Z., Ye, T."	"Zou, S., Xu, D., Deng, T., Huang, Q., Yu, D., Zhao, Z., Ye, T., 2019. Geochemical variations of the Late Mesozoic granitoids in the southern margin of North China Craton: A possible link to the tectonic transformation from compression to extension. Gondwana Research 75, 118-133."	"The composition of the continental crust of the North China Craton (NCC) is more felsic than that of the average bulk crust, which is regarded to be the result of the delamination of the thickened lower crust during Mesozoic. However, whether the thickened continental crust existed and when the delamination event happened along the southern margin of the NCC are still debated. Here, we report geochronological, geochemical and Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic evidence that granitoids from the Late Jurassic Wuzhangshan pluton and the Early Cretaceous Huashani complex were derived by partial melting of the lower crust with different thickness. Our new data shows that the two lithofacies of the Wuzhangshan pluton were mainly formed between ca. 157 and 156 Ma, whereas the five lithofacies of the Huashani complex were mainly emplaced between ca. 132 and 125 Ma. The Wuzhangshan pluton and the earlier four lithofacies granitoids of the Huashani complex (ca. 160â€?25 Ma) both display adakitic geochemical features, which are characterized by as high SiO2 (63.26â€?2.71 wt%), Al2O3 (13.97â€?6.89 wt%) and Sr (413â€?218 ppm) contents, and low Y (6.30â€?4.98 ppm) and YbN (1.55â€?.43), and high Sr/Y (33?112) and (La/Yb)N (11.53â€?9.72) ratios. They also have high (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.7066â€?.7086), and low ?Nd(t) (?9.9 to ?18.8) and ?Hf(t) (?11 to ?26) values, and two-stage Nd and Hf model ages ranging from 2.4 to 1.7 Ga and 2.7 to 1.7 Ga, respectively. In contrast, the late Early Cretaceous (ca. 125â€?10 Ma) granitoids have higher SiO2 (71.30â€?6.78 wt%) and lower Sr (64â€?33 ppm) contents, and lower Sr/Y (17â€?9) and (La/Yb)N (13.25â€?8.36) ratios, and similar ?Nd(t) (?10 to ?16) and relatively higher ?Hf(t) (?10 to ?14) values. These geochemical variations suggest that the ca.160â€?25 Ma granitoids were most probably produced by partial melting of thickened crust (>45 km) with eclogite, garnet amphibolite or amphibolite residues, whereas that the ca. 125â€?10 Ma granitoids were formed by partial melting of the thinner crust (<33 km). We thus suggest that the NCC likely underwent a synchronous tectonic transformation at ca. 125 Ma from a compressional setting with thickened crust to an intensive extensional setting with thinner crust at ca. 125 Ma, which demonstrates that the lower crust was most likely delaminated."	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2019.04.012					"Zou, et al., 2019"
