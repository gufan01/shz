However, few of them undertook a comprehensive study of clastic sedimentary rocks in the Cathaysia Block. This study reports the petrography and sedimentary facies, the whole-rock geochemistry and Sm-Nd isotopic data, and the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of detrital zircon from the Lower Silurian meta-siliciclastics on Hainan Island in order to constrain the early Paleozoic tectonic setting. The source rocks for the Lower Silurian meta-siliciclastics have suffered moderate to intense weathering, indicated by the weathering indices, like Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) and Weathering Index (W index). The Lower Silurian rocks have high Th/Sc (generally between 1.1 and 2.0) and Th/U (generally between 4 and 6) ratios, LREE-enriched REE patterns with negative Eu anomalies (avg. 0.55), and low ?Nd(t) values (-16.2 to -8.5), suggesting a continental margin basin receiving detritus mostly derived from a recycled-orogen or cratonic provenance. This Early Silurian turbiditic succession with rhythmic flysch and incomplete Bouma sequences also reveals a neritic to abyssal facies, continental shelf to continental slope depositional setting. The geochemical features like the pattern of REEs, the ratios of trace elements (e.g., Th/Sc, Th/Co, La/Sc, Cr/Th, La/Th), and the binary plots and ternary diagrams (e.g., A-CN-K and FMW diagram), demonstrate that the source-areas are dominated by felsic rocks. Together with the two-stage Nd depleted mantle model age (TDM-2) (ca. 2.3 Ga), the detrital zircon U-Pb age populations with peaks mainly at ca. 1635 Ma confirm that the source rocks are dominated by the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group and ca. 1430 Ma granitoids on Hainan Island. Linked to the early Paleozoic tectonic development of South China, the Lower Silurian siliciclastic rocks on Hainan Island can be interpreted as depositing in a passive continent margin."	https://doi:10.1016/j.jseaes.2016.04.011					"Zou, et al., 2016"
2016-01-15	"Geochemical and Nd isotopic constraints on provenance and depositional setting of the Shihuiding Formation in the Shilu Fe–Co–Cu ore district, Hainan Province, South China"	Journal of Asian Earth Sciences		"Yu, L., Zou, S., Cai, J., Xu, D., Zou, F., Wang, Z., Wu, C., Liu, M."	"Yu, L., Zou, S., Cai, J., Xu, D., Zou, F., Wang, Z., Wu, C., Liu, M., 2016. Geochemical and Nd isotopic constraints on provenance and depositional setting of the Shihuiding Formation in the Shilu Fe–Co–Cu ore district, Hainan Province, South China. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences 119, 100–117. "	"The Shihuiding Formation, a subordinate succession hosting the Fe-Co-Cu ores, is a suite of Neoproterozoic terrigenous clastic rocks occurring in the Shilu Fe-Co-Cu ore district of the Hainan Island, South China. Integrated petrographical, geochemical, and Nd isotopic analyses have been carried out on 23 sandstone specimens of the Shihuiding Formation in order to understand their provenance and the tectonic setting of their deposition. The samples can be divided into two groups, quartzose sandstones (13 samples) and ferruginous sandstones (10 samples). The ferruginous sandstones have average SiO2and Fetotalcontents of 77.23 wt.% and 18.09 wt.%, respectively, and this contrasts with the higher average SiO2(94.04 wt.%) and lower Fetotal(2.67 wt.%) contents of the quartzose sandstones. The bivariant Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios indicate a predominantly recycled sedimentary provenance, and the low to medium degrees of weathering are commonly indicated by an average chemical index of maturity (CIM) of 81 and an average chemical index of alteration (CIA) of 68. The Shihuiding Formation sandstones have REE contents of 21-249ppm, with LREE/HREE=9.18 and ?Eu=0.67. The ?Nd(970Ma) values of -5.7 to -3.4, and model (TDM) ages of 2099-1773Ma are compatible with a source mainly from the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group, a suite of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks intruded by ca. 1450Ma granites. Quantitative provenance modeling indicates that the Shihuiding Formation sandstones are best modeled with a mixture of 29% plagioclase-amphibole gneiss (29 P), 38% quartz-muscovite schist (38 Q), and 33% granite (33 G) detritus. Mixing the ?Ndvalues of the sandstones, calculated at 970Ma, indicates that the sediment received 22-47% (average 34%) of its detritus from the Baoban Group quartz-muscovite schists. Components from hydrothermal fluids may also have been involved during deposition of the Shihuiding Formation sandstones, as revealed by a bivariant Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) vs. Fe/Ti plot, positive Eu anomalies, and negative Y anomalies relative to PAAS. Tectonic discrimination diagrams, such as La-Th-Sc and Th-Co-Zr/10, indicate a passive continental margin setting for the deposition of the Shihuiding Formation. In terms of its geological setting, we propose that the Shihuiding Formation was deposited in a peripheral foreland basin, supplied by detritus shed from the Grenville Orogenic Belt during the assemblage of the Rodinia Supercontinent."	doi:10.1016/j.jseaes.2016.01.015					"Yu, et al., 2016"

Ore Geology Reviews		"Zou, S., Zou, F., Ning, J., Deng, T., Yu, D., Ye, T., Xu, D., Wang, Z."	"Zou, S., Zou, F., Ning, J., Deng, T., Yu, D., Ye, T., Xu, D., Wang, Z., 2018. A stand-alone Co mineral deposit in northeastern Hunan Province, South China: Its timing, origin of ore fluids and metal Co, and geodynamic setting. Ore Geology Reviews 92, 42–60. "	"The Hengdong cobalt (Co) deposit, located in northeastern Hunan Province of South China, is hosted by the low-grade metamorphic volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks of the early Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group. The Co orebodies strictly controlled by the NE- to ENE-trending Changsha-Pingjiang deep fault zone (CPDFZ) and its secondary structures. Occurring in altered breccias and cataclasites with similar mineral assemblages, Co mineralization is characterized by zoned alteration with predominant silicification and chloritization proximal to the orebodies, and sericitization and carbonatization distal from the mineralization. The integrated field and microscope observations reveal three hydrothermal stages marked by quartz + pyrite + muscovite ± chalcopyrite of the early-stage mineralization (E-stage), quartz + polymetallic sulfides + chlorite of the middle-stage mineralization (M?stage), and quartz + chlorite + carbonate of the late-stage mineralization (L-stage). Muscovite from both the E-stage Co-bearing altered breccia and the CPDFZ mylonite yield40Ar–39Ar plateau ages of 124.7 ± 0.6 Ma (1?) and 130.3 ± 1.4 Ma (1?), respectively, indicating an early Cretaceous mineralization likely associated with the last movement of CPDFZ strike-slip shearing. The ?34S values of pyrite and chalcopyrite ranging from ?1.5 to ?15.9% with a majority between ?7.5 and ?15.9%, and the lead isotope compositions of the pyrite (206Pb/204Pb = 18.156–18.761,207Pb/204Pb = 15.645–15.662 and208Pb/204Pb = 38.469–39.172) overlapping with those of upper crust, indicate a main crust-derived source. The chemical compositions of pyrite further indicate the ore fluids and metal Co of the Hengdong deposit are most likely linked to the meta-mafic and volcanic rocks of the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Lianyunshan Group, but with a contamination by the wall rocks of Lengjiaxi Group and Lianyunshan granitoids. Fluid inclusion investigations from Hengdong deposit reveal the decreasing homogenization temperatures from 250 to 320 °C (peak of 280–300 °C) at the E stage, through ?220–320 °C (peak of 270–300 °C) at the M stage, and to ?150–230 °C at the L stage without obviously salinity (7.0–15 wt% NaCl equiv.) changed. In the M?stage, the presence of coexisting LV inclusions and V-rich inclusions with the similar homogenization temperature, consistent with the chlorite geothermometry data, is interpreted to be the result of fluid immiscibility, which was caused by cyclic pressure release during fault-zone movement. Combined with the Late Mesozoic tectonism of South China, the present data support the Hengdong deposit formed under an extension-associated tectonic regime most likely induced by slab roll-back of the subducted Paleo-Pacific Plate during the early Cretaceous. This extensional event not only caused the reactivation of the pre-existing structures as manifested by the CPDFZ characteristic of stress transformation from compression to extension but also likely resulted in the release of large amounts of Co-bearing ore fluids from the Proterozoic or older volcanogenic rocks. When the ore fluids migrated along the CPDFZ and its secondary faults, the decompression (adiabatic cooling) of the hydrothermal fluids shifted the ore fluid to the immiscibility field, significantly reduced the degree of cobalt undersaturation, and caused cobalt to precipitate, which finally formed the Hengdong Co mineral deposit."	doi:10.1016/j.oregeorev.2017.11.008					"Zou, et al., 2018"
